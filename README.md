This is my personal website which showcases the projects that I am most proud of as well as doubling as my online resume. I am a software developer who has an interest in game design and development. I have recently graduated from a 6 month full stack web development immersive course taught by General Assembly and Per Scholas. During my time spent within these two organizations I have built many projects, most of which can found among my repositories, learned many skills and technologies, and have worked with a number of other developers and UX designers. Prior to enrolling into this program, I had just graduated from Colgate University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Mathematics. My strong mathematical background combined with the knowledge gained of computer science fundamentals (Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Operating Systems) laid the foundation for me to become the analytical, creative, problem-solving developer that I am today.
